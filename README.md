* The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the highest level of men's English football.
* In this project our goal is to use both SQL and python in order to make useful tables and graphs about the premier league season 2018/2019
* In this project I did visualizations using two methods, the first is graphs created using seaborn and matplotlib. while the second way is by using Plotly so that I'll have interactive graphs.
* you can check the first one [here](https://github.com/YoussefBouyaddou/Premier-League-Analysis/blob/main/premier%20league%20analysis%20using%20seaborn.ipynb)
* To check the Plotly notebook click [here](https://github.com/YoussefBouyaddou/Premier-League-Analysis/blob/main/premier%20league%20interactive.ipynb)

**Note:** in GitHub, interactive graphs can't be displayed in notebooks so you can check them here:

# Premier-League-Analysis

* The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the highest level of the men's English football.
* In this project our goal is to use both sql and python in order to make useful tables and graphs about premier league season 2018/2019
* Download data from [here](https://sqlsoccer.com/set-up-scripts/)
* In this project i did visualisations using two methods, the first is usual graphs created using seaborn and matplotlib. while the second way is by using plotly so that i'll have interractive graphs.
* you can check the first one [here](https://github.com/YoussefBouyaddou/Premier-League-Analysis/blob/main/premier%20league%20analysis%20using%20seaborn.ipynb)
* to check the plotly notebook click [here](https://github.com/YoussefBouyaddou/Premier-League-Analysis/blob/main/premier%20league%20interactive.ipynb)
